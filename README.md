# rust-oware-ai
A Rust implementation of an Oware AI. Using minimax algorithm, alphabeta pruning and move sorting.

The purpose of this project is to compare the performances to a similar project written with C++.
I used crossbeam::scope for the multithreading aspect, and there is some unit tests for the board.
This Rust version is apparently the faster one.
